CalConFit - Calorie Conscious Fitness

Minimalistic web app allows users to track their daily calorie intake, create squads, invite their friends and view their squad members' intake, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), TypeScript, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

Each squad member can add their own calories and view the individual calorie intake of every other squad member in the squad.
